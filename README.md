Question：
I am a project manager, need to set up a year's goals. I manager two projects. one is CFM and another is CLUE. one category type is Delivery including these items: 1. Deliver assigned projects with technical excellence. 2. Deliver high quality code. 3. Develop technical implementation plans and complete DAGs in a timely manner.

Delivery Goals for CFM and CLUE Projects:
1.	Deliver Assigned Projects with Technical Excellence:
•	Objective: Ensure that all projects, both CFM and CLUE, are delivered with a high standard of technical excellence.
•	Key Results:
•	Achieve a 95% or higher satisfaction rate from stakeholders regarding technical implementation.
•	Complete projects within the specified timeline while adhering to technical standards.
•	Conduct regular technical reviews to identify and address any potential issues early in the development process.
2.	Deliver High-Quality Code:
•	Objective: Maintain a high level of code quality across both CFM and CLUE projects to enhance reliability and scalability.
•	Key Results:
•	Achieve a code review satisfaction rate of at least 90% from the development team.
•	Reduce the average number of bugs reported per release by 20% compared to the previous year.
•	Implement automated testing procedures to ensure code quality and minimize the occurrence of regressions.
3.	Develop Technical Implementation Plans and Complete DAGs in a Timely Manner:
•	Objective: Streamline the technical planning process and ensure the timely completion of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for all projects.
•	Key Results:
•	Develop comprehensive technical implementation plans for each project before the commencement of development, ensuring alignment with project objectives and requirements.
•	Complete DAGs for all projects within two weeks of project initiation.
•	Regularly monitor and update DAGs as project requirements evolve or change, ensuring accuracy and relevance throughout the project lifecycle.
Additional Considerations:
•	Regular Performance Reviews: Schedule periodic performance reviews to track progress towards these goals and make any necessary adjustments to ensure their achievement.
•	Continuous Learning and Improvement: Encourage team members to participate in training programs or workshops to enhance their technical skills and stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices.
•	Effective Communication: Foster open and transparent communication channels within the project teams to facilitate collaboration and address any issues or concerns promptly.
By aligning your yearly goals with these key areas of focus, you can effectively drive the successful delivery of both CFM and CLUE projects while maintaining a high standard of technical excellence.
CFM和CLUE项目的交付目标：
以卓越的技术交付指定的项目：

目标：确保CFM和CLUE的所有项目都以高标准的卓越技术交付。
关键结果：
利益相关者对技术实施的满意度达到95%或更高。
在规定的时间内完成项目，同时遵守技术标准。
定期进行技术审查，以在开发过程的早期发现并解决任何潜在问题。
提供高质量代码：

目标：在CFM和CLUE项目中保持高水平的代码质量，以增强可靠性和可扩展性。
关键结果：
实现开发团队至少90%的代码审查满意度。
与前一年相比，将每次发布报告的错误平均数量减少20%。
实施自动化测试程序以确保代码质量并最大限度地减少回归的发生。
制定技术实施计划并及时完成DAG：

目标：简化技术规划流程，确保所有项目及时完成有向无循环图（DAG）。
关键结果：
在开发开始前，为每个项目制定全面的技术实施计划，确保与项目目标和要求相一致。
在项目启动后两周内完成所有项目的DAG。
随着项目需求的发展或变化，定期监控和更新DAG，确保整个项目生命周期的准确性和相关性。
其他注意事项：
定期绩效评估：安排定期绩效评估，以跟踪实现这些目标的进展，并做出任何必要的调整，以确保其实现。
持续学习和改进：鼓励团队成员参加培训计划或研讨会，以提高他们的技术技能，并随时了解最新的行业趋势和最佳实践。
有效沟通：在项目团队中建立公开透明的沟通渠道，以促进合作并及时解决任何问题或担忧。
通过将您的年度目标与这些重点领域相一致，您可以有效地推动CFM和CLUE项目的成功交付，同时保持高标准的卓越技术。
