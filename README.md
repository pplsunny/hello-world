Risk & Control Goals: Enhancing Professional Quality and Mitigating Risks

Compliance and Risk Management: Throughout 2023, I prioritized strict adherence to our company's rules and regulations. I consistently fulfilled my departmental responsibilities and ensured the smooth operation of all functions, which played a crucial role in preventing security risk incidents.

Continuous Learning: In 2023, I completed all relevant training sessions promptly. This commitment to continuous learning allowed me to stay up-to-date with the latest industry developments and best practices.

Effective Project Management: A significant part of my year involved formulating reasonable and effective project plans. I maintained open lines of communication with both upstream and downstream teams, fostering collaboration and ensuring the successful execution of projects.

System Security: System security remained a top priority. I actively worked on identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, improving code quality, and upgrading legacy dependencies. In the second quarter, I read "API Security in Action" and implemented best practices in our project development.

Financial Performance Goals: Improving Team Capabilities and Productivity

Architectural Enhancement: I played a key role in the TTS Architecture Review Process (ARP) and actively participated in the ART and ARB processes. This included the integrated CIP DAG review in the first quarter and Customer-Credit Attribute Consumption from CFM and WLCR in the third and fourth quarters. These efforts standardized and streamlined the LMS Integration Platform (LIP).

Continuous Improvement: Regular architecture design meetings were held to iterate the LIP solution, enhancing its functionality. I successfully completed system architecture documentation specifications in the first quarter and technical solutions, including integration with CFM, WLCR, and CIP, in the second quarter. By the third and fourth quarters, I implemented Customer-Credit Attribute Consumption from CFM and WLCR for GLS and provided Account posting restrictions for GCE.

Advanced Function Development: I led efforts to design and develop advanced functions for the LMS Integration Platform. This included improving interface parameters, ensuring cache data consistency, and implementing API version control.

CI/CD Optimization: My focus on enhancing our CI/CD process led me to study LightSpeed to optimize it. This included improving the BlackDuck scanning process and providing plug-in support for external third-party program integration and deployment.

Continuous Learning: I dedicated time to improve my technical expertise, completing "Software Architecture: The Hard Parts" by the second quarter and "Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems" by the third quarter.

Client & Franchise Outcomes Goals: Cross-Functional Team Ownership

Collaboration: I actively engaged with global technical teams, organizing routine meetings and Scrum teams to drive projects forward. I contributed to GLS and GCE initiatives by ensuring the timely completion of Customer-Credit Attribute Consumption from CFM and WLCR.

Business Acumen: My commitment to strengthening communication with business teams allowed me to learn business knowledge and contribute innovative solutions.

Team Leadership: I focused on enhancing team leadership and execution. I mastered the release process of the ECS platform, participated in the EAP process, and guided the team to better align with Citi's API specification standards. I also provided guidance on disaster recovery and load balancing schemes to the LIP gateway service.

In summary, 2023 was a year of significant achievement and progress toward our goals in risk management, financial performance, and cross-functional team ownership. These accomplishments reflect my dedication to enhancing professional quality, mitigating risks, and driving the success of our projects. I am looking forward to building on this foundation in the coming year.
