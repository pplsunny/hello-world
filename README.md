Risk & Control Goals

Compliance and Security: Throughout the year, I dedicated myself to upholding the highest standards of compliance with our company's rules and regulations. By fulfilling the responsibilities of my department, I ensured that no security risk incidents occurred, contributing to a safer work environment for all.

Training: I successfully completed all applicable 2023 training, demonstrating my commitment to ongoing professional development and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

Project Management: I took a proactive approach to project management by formulating reasonable and effective project plans. Collaborating closely with upstream and downstream teams, I ensured smooth project execution and delivery.

System Security: Paying vigilant attention to system security, I actively worked on avoiding vulnerabilities, cleaning up suboptimal code, and upgrading legacy dependencies. In line with my commitment to system security, I read the book titled "API Security in Action" and integrated best practices into project development in Q2 2023.

Financial Performance Goals

Architectural Excellence: I played a key role in enhancing our architectural processes by deeply engaging in the TTS Architecture Review Process (ARP) and participating in ART and ARB processes. My involvement in integrated CIP DAG reviews and Customer-Credit Attribute Consumption from CFM and WLCR processes in Q1, Q3, and Q4 ensured that the LMS Integration Platform (LIP) became more standardized and efficient.

Continuous Improvement: I organized weekly architecture design meetings, allowing us to iterate the LIP solution based on specific use cases, enhancing its functionality. By completing system architecture documentation and technical solutions, including integration with CFM, WLCR, and CIP, I contributed to our technical excellence in Q1 and Q2. Additionally, in Q3 and Q4 2023, I implemented Customer-Credit Attribute Consumption from CFM and WLCR for GLS and provided Account posting restrictions for GCE.

Innovation: I drove innovation by designing and developing advanced features for the LMS Integration Platform, including scalable interface parameters, cache data consistency, and API version control.

Technical Proficiency: To improve my technical prowess, I completed two essential books, "Software Architecture: The Hard Parts: Modern Trade-Off Analyses for Distributed Architectures" by Q2 2023 and "Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems" by Q3 2023.

Client & Franchise Outcomes Goals

Collaboration: I actively communicated with global technical teams and established routine meetings and Scrum teams to jointly promote project development. For GLS, I contributed to the successful implementation of Customer-Credit Attribute Consumption from CFM by Q3 2023 and Customer-Credit Attribute Consumption from WLCR by Q4 2023. For GCE, I facilitated integrations with the AMCAR service, providing Account posting restrictions by Q4 2023. For LMS Integration Platform (LIP), I collaborated with GCE, GLS, and GBNP to unify the development of common business functions, enhancing efficiency and consistency by Q4 2023.

Business Acumen: To strengthen communication with business teams, I learned the intricacies of various products, such as GCE and GLS. This allowed me to provide valuable solutions and plans that improved overall operations.

Leadership: I enhanced my leadership skills and execution abilities. By mastering the release process of the ECS platform, participating in the EAP process, and understanding network-based facilities, I guided teams to success and adhered to Citi's API specification standards.

Continuous Learning: To further my professional development, I sought opportunities to participate in E3 training.

In summary, 2023 was a year of remarkable achievements. I not only upheld rigorous standards in compliance and security but also excelled in project management and technical proficiency. My contributions to architectural excellence and innovation, coupled with effective collaboration, helped drive the success of our organization. I look forward to building on these accomplishments in the coming year.
