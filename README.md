Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the Task Recovery process in Flink's standalone High Availability setup using a more detailed sample scenario.

Sample Scenario:
Let's consider a Flink cluster processing a stream of e-commerce transactions with the following setup:
- 3 JobManager (JM) instances: JM-1 (leader), JM-2, JM-3
- 5 TaskManager (TM) instances: TM-1, TM-2, TM-3, TM-4, TM-5
- Job: Real-time fraud detection on transaction data
- Source: Kafka topic with 10 partitions
- Operators: Parse JSON, Enrich Data, Detect Fraud, Sink to Database

Now, let's go through the Task Recovery process step by step when TM-3 fails unexpectedly.

1. Failure Detection:
   - ZooKeeper detects that TM-3 has stopped sending heartbeats.
   - ZooKeeper notifies the leader JobManager (JM-1) about TM-3's failure.
   - JM-1 marks TM-3 as failed and initiates the recovery process.

2. Task Reassignment:
   - JM-1 identifies the tasks that were running on TM-3:
     * 2 Kafka source tasks (partitions 4 and 5)
     * 1 Parse JSON task
     * 1 Enrich Data task
     * 1 Detect Fraud task
   - JM-1 marks these tasks as failed and prepares to reassign them.

3. Task Checkpoint Retrieval:
   - JM-1 accesses the latest successful checkpoint stored in the configured state backend (e.g., HDFS).
   - The checkpoint contains:
     * Kafka offsets for partitions 4 and 5
     * State of the Parse JSON, Enrich Data, and Detect Fraud operators

4. Task Redistribution:
   - JM-1 analyzes the available resources on the remaining TaskManagers.
   - JM-1 decides to redistribute the failed tasks:
     * Kafka source (partition 4) → TM-1
     * Kafka source (partition 5) → TM-2
     * Parse JSON → TM-4
     * Enrich Data → TM-5
     * Detect Fraud → TM-4

5. Task Resumption:
   - JM-1 sends the task deployment instructions to the selected TaskManagers.
   - Each TaskManager receives the checkpoint data for its assigned tasks:
     * TM-1 and TM-2 receive Kafka offsets to resume reading from the correct position.
     * TM-4 and TM-5 receive the state of the Parse JSON, Enrich Data, and Detect Fraud operators.
   - The TaskManagers initialize the tasks with the received checkpoint data.
   - Tasks resume processing from their last known good state:
     * Kafka sources start consuming from the stored offsets.
     * Stateful operators (Enrich Data, Detect Fraud) restore their state from the checkpoint.

6. Job Progress Monitoring:
   - JM-1 continues to monitor the overall job progress.
   - JM-1 tracks metrics such as:
     * Processing rate of each task
     * Latency between operators
     * Backpressure indicators
   - If any issues are detected (e.g., increased latency), JM-1 may trigger further optimizations or task reassignments.

7. Failure Reporting:
   - JM-1 logs the failure of TM-3 and the subsequent recovery process.
   - JM-1 updates the job status to reflect the recovery action.
   - If configured, JM-1 may send notifications to external monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) about the failure and recovery.
   - The cluster continues to operate with 4 TaskManagers until TM-3 is brought back online or replaced.

Throughout this process, the Flink job continues to process incoming transactions with minimal interruption. The use of checkpoints ensures that no data is lost, and the system maintains exactly-once processing semantics.

This detailed example demonstrates how Flink's task recovery mechanism works in practice, showcasing its ability to handle node failures and maintain continuous data processing in a distributed environment.
